 * Animated statistics band.

 * number that never stops changing is unreadable and looks like a bug.
 *
 * The animation is driven by `requestAnimationFrame` rather than a library, and
 * it is skipped entirely for visitors who prefer reduced motion, who get the
 * final value immediately. The `<span>` holding the number carries the real
 * value as its text content, so the figure is correct in the accessibility tree
 * and in the DOM even while the counter is still running.
