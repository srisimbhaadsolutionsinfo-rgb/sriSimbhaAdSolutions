  intro:
    "We are an advertising agency based in Gajuwaka, Visakhapatnam. Since 2019 we have been putting brands in front of people who are already on the move — on LED screens in busy junctions, printed on the tea cup they are holding, on a vehicle that drives past their house, and on the phone in their hand.",

  story: [
    "We started with one screen. It went up outside a busy junction in Gajuwaka, and the owner of the shop next door asked whether we would put his number on it too. He did, and so did the shop after him. That was the whole business at the start: a screen people actually looked at, and a number they could call.",
    "What has changed is the range. We still run those screens, and we now also print on tea cups, put video on vehicles, film advertisements, build websites and run digital campaigns. What has not changed is the way the work gets done — one team, a written quote, and a creative change live the same day you ask for it.",
    "Most of our clients come to us after trying a poster. Posters cost almost nothing and are usually ignored within a day. A screen in the right place costs more and is seen by the same people several times a week, which is the difference between advertising and decoration.",
