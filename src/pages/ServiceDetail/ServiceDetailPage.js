        Keyed by slug so a related-service click builds a completely fresh set
        of motion components.

        Without the key, React reuses the same `motion.*` instances when only the
        `:slug` param changes, and each one carries a `whileInView` observer
        latched by `inViewOnce.once`. framer-motion evaluates that observer once
        on mount, and `ScrollToTop` jumps to the top in an effect that runs after
        the paint — so on the incoming page the sections were still below the
        fold at evaluation time, latched to the `hidden` variant, and `once`
        guaranteed they would never re-check. Key Benefits and the gallery were
        left at `opacity: 0` on every related-service transition (3 of 3
        reproduced), with every image fully downloaded but invisible.

        Remounting resets the observer, so the reveal runs against the new
        page's real layout after the scroll reset.
