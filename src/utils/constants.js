 * Navigation switches to the mobile panel below the `lg` breakpoint.

 * This used to be `md` (768px), which worked while the header wordmark was the
 * short "Simbha Ads". Widening the brand to "Sri Simbha Ad Solutions" added
 * roughly 130px, and at 768–1023px the header could no longer fit the logo, the
 * wordmark, four nav links and the theme switch: "About Us" and "Contact Us"
 * wrapped onto two lines (48px -> 76px tall) and the theme switch was pushed
 * past the right edge of the viewport.
 *
 * Raising the switch to `lg` gives the desktop bar room to breathe, and a
 * tablet at 768–1023px is better served by the slide-in panel than by four
 * cramped links. The panel and the bar are mutually exclusive, so this costs
 * nothing at either size.
