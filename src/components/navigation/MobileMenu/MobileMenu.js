/**
 * Slide-in navigation panel for small screens.
 *
 * Accessibility work over the original implementation:
 *  - the panel is a labelled `<nav>` referenced by `aria-controls`
 *  - `aria-expanded` on the trigger reflects the real state
 *  - Escape closes it, and clicking outside closes it
 *  - links are real anchors in a `<ul>`, and the menu closes on navigation
 *  - it is hidden from the accessibility tree *and* from tab order when closed
 *
 * `toggleRef` is the trigger button. It is excluded from the outside-click test
 * on purpose: a press on the trigger produces `pointerdown` (which the
 * outside-click handler sees as "outside the panel", so it closes) followed by
 * `click` (which the trigger's own handler sees as "toggle", so it re-opens).
 * The two handlers cancelled out and a second press on the hamburger left the
 * menu open. Treating the trigger as part of the panel leaves exactly one
 * handler responsible for it.

  /*
   * Stop the page behind the panel from scrolling.
   *
   * `useLockBodyScroll` already existed and was correct, but nothing called it,
   * so on a phone the open menu sat over content that still scrolled under the
   * visitor's thumb: dragging on the panel's own padding moved the page
   * underneath it, and on iOS the rubber-band effect dragged the whole document
   * past the header. The panel is shorter than the viewport, so it reads as a
   * sheet over a page — the page is not supposed to move while it is up.
   *
   * Scoped to `isOpen`, so the lock is held for exactly as long as the panel is
   * showing, and the hook restores the previous `overflow` / `padding-right`
   * (compensating for the scrollbar width) on the way out.
